# Gadget.com-DatabaseDesign
This project was done was done as part of our Database Design class and was intended to show our abilities concerning connecting a database to a front-end website.
We created a website that would allow a user to select different attributes of devices to help reduce a users choice to fewer options.
The idea for this project was to use a database to display and retrieve information for a webpage. The project is currently incomplete.
We had to learn how to use Hibernate to do this project and we only managed to get the laptop and the user part of the project running.

However, even though the learning curve was steep, we managed to learn Hibernate and get the job done.
